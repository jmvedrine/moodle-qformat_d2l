#d2l XML question import format

This Moodle question import format can import questions exported from the desire2learn LMS as a QTI2 zip archive into Moodle.

It was created by Jean-Michel Vedrine.
##Installation
To install, either download the zip file, unzip it, and place it in the moodle/question/format directory. (You will need to rename the directory from "moodle-qformat_d2l" to just "d2l".)

Alternatively, get the code using git by running the following commands in the top level folder of your Moodle install:

git clone git://github.com/jmvedrine/moodle-qformat_d2l.git question/format/d2l
echo '/question/format/d2l/' >> .git/info/exclude


You must visit Site administration and install it like any other Moodle plugin.

It will then add a new choice when you import questions in the question bank.
